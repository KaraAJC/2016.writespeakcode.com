  quote: Spending the days with other women developers changed my mindset about my own skills and what I can do. It was an eye opener in the most energizing way. I am not an imposter. I am capable, accomplished, and contributing. Thank you, Write/Speak/Code!

  quote: Write/Speak/Code was the most amazing professional development event I've been to as a technologist. Often, the events I've been to in technology have been focused on presenting people's work and not developing my own skills. Also, the women's events while focused on skill building, were not targeted to my leadership development needs. Write/Speak/Code helped me identify ways I could become a more active member of the broader tech community and promote my own skill set.
