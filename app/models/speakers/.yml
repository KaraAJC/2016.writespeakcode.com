    I’ve been negotiating salary and rate with and on behalf of IT consultants for years, and firmly believe that a major contributor to the wage gap is that women don’t negotiate their salaries. So from the first job we take, we’re behind the curve and never catch up.

    I’ll present the theories behind how to negotiate and demonstrate how it should actually sound. We’ll cover how to understand your worth, when to stick to your guns and how to use benefits and flexibility to build a great package for yourself. I’ll give an insider’s look into negotiating with recruiters, and give you the tools to establish a firm footing for a great salary negotiation.
