    <p>After growing up in Michigan, LaToya moved to Florida and dabbled in real estate before relocating to Chicago, Illinois and realizing she was meant to code. She&#39;s hugely active in the Ruby community in Chicago, working with Windy City Rails and ChicagoRuby Hack Night. She&#39;s code-obsessed and currently devoting some time to teach herself Rust. Outside of coding, she&#39;s busy taking kickboxing classes, running with motivation from her favorite app, Zombies, Run!, and taking drawing classes from a local art center.</p>
