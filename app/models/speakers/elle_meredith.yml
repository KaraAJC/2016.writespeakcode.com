    <p>Elle has been building websites for over a decade. Since 2007, those websites have been in Ruby. She was a Ruby Australia committee member, an organiser for Ruby Conf AU 2014, and Rails Girls Sydney events. Elle is a co-organiser for GORUCO 2016 conference and Rails Camp USA East Coast. She also runs women&#39;s work jelly at the NYC office. When she is not immersed in the Ruby community, she is probably immersed in water. You can talk to her on Twitter.</p>
