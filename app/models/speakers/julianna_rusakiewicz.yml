  :bio: |
    <p>Actor turned designer turned developer, I am a bootcamp graduate trying to make my way in an ever-changing and growing field. I grew up in New England and became an adult in New York City, so I yearn for the city and the woods. I primarily develop in Ruby on Rails and AngualrJS, though I am often asked to update Wordpress sites. After 15 years in the Theater scene, I accepted a position at a creative agency in Midtown Manhattan. I am constantly learning and trying new things!</p>
