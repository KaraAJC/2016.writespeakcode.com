    <p>Naomi Ceder has been learning, teaching, using, and talking about Python
        since 2001. She is the author of the
        <a href='http://amzn.to/1Wrr4ab'>Quick Python Book, 2nd edition</a>, the
        sprints organizer for <a href='https://us.pycon.org/2016/community/sprints/'>PyCon</a>,
        and the co-founder of <a href='http://trans-code.org/'>Trans*Code</a>, a UK based
        hack day focussing on trans issues. Having worked as an organizer in various
        communities for almost 20 years, Naomi is a member of the board of directors
        of the <a href='https://www.python.org/psf/'>Python Software Foundation</a>
        for 2015/2016. She speaks about her own
        experiences of marginalization with the hope of making the communities she
        loves more diverse and welcoming. In her spare time she enjoys knitting and
        deep philosophical conversations with her dogs.</p>
