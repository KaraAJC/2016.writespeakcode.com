  :bio: |
    <p>Liz Abinante lives in Portland, Oregon and works as a Senior Software Engineer at New Relic. She is infectiously enthusiastic about web development, teaching, learning, and feminism. She enjoys speaking at conferences, knitting, sewing, and a hacking away on interesting problems. Her greatest dream in life is to spend her entire day surrounded by puppies while coding. She swears she&#39;s a lot more interesting than this bio makes her sound. She&#39;s often been compared to cartoon characters due to her enomorous personality and penchant for sing/dancing her way through life.</p>
